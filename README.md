You can either install via Testflight to run on your device, or clone the project and run on a simulator via XCode.

## 2. XCode

1. Git clone or download the project.
2. In the root directory install the required Cocoapods using `pod install` (requires Cocoapods to be installed)
3. Open the project workspace (`GoldenShoe.xcworkspace` *not* `GoldenShoe.xcodeproj`).
4. Run via simulator (Mainly tested using iPhone 12 simulator running iOS 14).
